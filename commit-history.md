# Silvermine Coding Standards: Commit History

All Silvermine codebases use git for version control. This gives us phenomenal
powers to review the history of the codebase and see where and why a change was
introduced. To get the most of that power, we have strict rules about our
commit history, outlined in this document.

A commit history can easily be polluted when commits are not well-crafted. The
basic principle is **each commit should be for a single piece of work, well
described, and not contain unrelated changes**.

Here are some rules about commits:

**Commits that contain only code review changes are never allowed.** Let's say
that you start a branch for a new feature or a bugfix, and that branch contains
one or more commits. Then you get your work reviewed and the reviewer requests
changes. You *must rebase* and fix the actual commit that introduced the
problem the reviewer wants you to fix. For example, if he wants you to rename a
variable or fix a whitespace error, go fix it in the commit that you introduced
the error (or poorly-named variable) in.

Why is this so important? Later on, some poor developer is going to be trying
to trace the history of a piece of code to see when a change was introduced.
Imagine if they do git blame or git log and look at the commits that introduced
a change, but that change was just to fix whitespace or rename a variable. This
is very frustrating. Or, if the code review comment was more substantial - an
actual refactoring of the work you did - then the work that should be contained
in one autonomous commit is broken into two or more commits. This makes it very
hard to retrace the steps that actually led to a piece of code being
introduced.

*Remember that this "poor developer" that we speak of could be you*. Be kind to
your future self, or to those who succeed you.

**Commits should be for a single piece of work.** Do not make one commit do
many things. For example, "fixed foo and added new bar functionality" is not a
good commit. Future you will come back to see where a piece of code was added,
and coming upon this commit as the place it originated will now have to figure
out "was the code added to fix foo? or to add bar?"


## Rebasing

As you can tell from the comments above, knowledge of how to do a git rebase is
very important to your workflow. You will be expected to use a rebase to fix
code that is in a branch you're requesting to have merged. Thus, become
proficient at rebasing if you are not already. If you need help, [Pro
Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/) has a good [chapter on
rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History)

**IMPORTANT:** when you rebase for a pull request, *do not rebase off of master
unless there are merge conflicts*. If you rebase off master between the first
review and the re-review, the reviewer now has to re-review the entire pull
request rather than just what you changed since he last reviewed the code. *You
should only rebase off of master when it is absolutely necessary due to merge
conflicts, and even then you should work with the reviewer to know when he
would like that done. Perhaps it could be done after the review is 100%
complete.*

Instead of rebasing off master, you want to rebase off the last common commit
that you have with master.

For example, imagine this scenario where you created a branch off of master and
while you were working on it, several new commits were added to master.

```text
Master:

A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H
*---*---*---*---*---*---*---*
         \
Your      \---*---*---*---*
Branch        R   S   T   U
```

You've added commits R, S, T, and U to your branch after branching off of
master's commit C. Thus, your commit history (`git log`) is A, B, C, R, S, T,
U.

At this point if you rebased off of master (e.g. `git rebase origin/master`),
you would end up with this history:

```text
Master:

A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H
*---*---*---*---*---*---*---*
                             \
Your                          \---*---*---*---*
Branch                            R2  S2  T2  U2
```

That means your history is now A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, R2, S2, T2, U2. (R
through U have "2" added because they are now new commits that are different
from the original R through U). It also means that when your reviewer compares
the difference in commits U and U2 (your original last commit and your new last
commit) they will also be seeing all of the changes that you pulled in from
master (namely, D through H). This makes the re-review painful and typically
leads to the reviewer not being able to review just your changes, but requires
them to re-review everything in your branch (R2 through U2).

The better solution is to rebase off of your common commit (C in this example),
which will give you a history like this:

```text
Master:

A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H
*---*---*---*---*---*---*---*
         \
Your      \---*---*---*---*
Branch        R2  S2  T2  U2
```

In this scenario, each of your commits changed, but their common ancestor (C)
did not. Thus, `git diff U..U2` will allow the reviewer to see only the changes
that you introduced since he reviewed it last. **This will make not only the
reviewer's life better, but also your own** because it means your code can be
merged sooner.


### Rebasing Off Common Ancestor

Given all that we talked about above, you may have the question **how do I
rebase off the common ancestor of my feature branch?**

This is a two-step process:

```text
# Find the common ancestory between your branch and the branch you are trying to
# merge into (in this case the merge target is master):
MERGE_BASE=$(git merge-base master my_branch)

# Then do your interactive rebase off of that commit:
git rebase -i ${MERGE_BASE}
```


## Commit Messages

We care a great deal about having good commit messages. In fact, we care so much that we
use commitlint in most of our repos to ensure properly formatted commit messages. Chris
Beams wrote a good blog post about why good commit messages matter. Please read and apply
his post: <https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/>

It's also worth reading this post: <https://fatbusinessman.com/2019/my-favourite-git-commit>

Additional notes:

   * The commit must start with a type followed by a colon and a space. Possible
     types are:
      * **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies.
      * **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files. Also used
        for releases.
      * **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts.
      * **config**: Changes to how a service runs.
      * **docs**: Changes only affecting documentation.
      * **feat**: A new feature.
      * **fix**: A bug fix.
      * **sub(type)**: Any smaller chunk of a defined type.
         * For example: sub(feat): some small part of my feature
      * **perf**: A code change that improves performance.
      * **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
      * **revert**: Reverts a previous commit.
      * **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
        (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
      * **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
   * We should put **(#xxxxx)** (where xxxxx is the issue number) in the
     subject of all commit messages as the last item.
      * The article shows it at the end, but `git log --oneline` shows only the
        subject, and itâ€™s really handy to have the issue number there.
      * In some cases a commit references multiple issues. In that case, you can
        list those issues at the end of the body of the commit message and leave
        it out of the subject. _See the examples below for acceptable forms when
        a commit references multiple issues._
   * The header (type + subject + issue #) must be no more than 72 characters long.
   * The max line length of the body is 90 characters.
   * Use markdown formatting in your commit messages, including a space before
     either an asterisk or a numbered list if doing ordered/unordered lists. This
     formats them properly in most source control and project management systems.
   * Commit messages should focus more on explaining the "why" than the how.
     The commit itself (the code changes) represent the "how". Someone will be
     looking at the git history (your message) to figure out *why* you did what you
     did.

Here is an example of a commit we might craft. It explains what and why more
than how. The how is shown by seeing the code changes with `git show $hash`.

feat: Remove flux capacitor from DeLorean (#12345)

The annual corporate meeting will occur on October 3, 2015 this year,
and big announcements will be made at that time. However, Marty McFly
and Doc Brown will both have traveled forward to October 21, 2015, and
in the pages of *Gray's Sports Almanac* will be copies of the
announcements made at the annual meeting. When they return to 1985, they
will unfortunately turn traitor and spread the word of the future
announcements, which we need to prevent.

There were several ways we could have prevented this from happening:

 1. Intercept the lightning in front of courthouse on November 12, 1955 at precisely
    10:04pm, trapping both Marty and the Doc in 1955
 2. Destroy the partial bridge over the Shonash/Clayton/Eastwood Ravine prior to
    September 4, 1885
 3. Remove the flux capacitor from the DeLorean before Marty and the Doc could take their
    first trip on October 21, 1985

I chose option three because I was actually alive at the time. If I'd
chosen options one or two it would have required that I travel back to
1955, which in itself could have caused problems with the time-space
continuum. It was also hoped that by completely removing the flux
capacitor it would prevent Marty and the Doc from traveling to any other
time periods and spoiling other great advances in our organization's
future. Of course, the Doc is known to be resourceful and has even used
[steam](https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7416/10344460816_4d0ce7cfdf_b.jpg)
to power at least one flux capacitor, so even this fix may not be
sufficient.

### Referencing Multiple Issues in One Commit Message

Here are acceptable forms for referencing issues when a single commit references
multiple issues. Note, though, that some of these example commits may be cases
where breaking the commit up into multiple commits would be better. If a single
fix or a change to one block of code does fix multiple issues, though, here are
the formats that are acceptable for the combined commit message:

```text
fix: There are only two issues and it fits nicely (#12345, #54321)

The rest of my description goes here ...
```

Or where you want to provide details about the fix for each issue independently:

```text
feat: Ensure flux capacitor can reach 1.21 gigawatts when needed

 * Refs #12345: If the car achieved a speed of `>= 89` MPH while the flux
   capacitor was only getting anywhere `>= 1.00` and `< 1.21` gigawatts from its
   power source, the computer would put the power source in "limp home" mode,
   only allowing it to generate roughly 300 watts - enough to power the
   dashboard displays.
 * Refs #54321: When the _Mr. Fusion_ generator is being used to power hover
   mode, and the car is hovering less than 12 feet off the ground, and the car
   is traveling `>= 32` MPH, the generator would not engage time travel mode,
   thus not generating the required 1.21 gigawatts necessary to power the flux
   capacitor.
```

Or where one change resolves multiple issues, and the list of issues is too long
to put in the title of the commit:

```text
feat: Ensure flux capacitor can reach 1.21 gigawatts when needed

In several scenarios the flux capacitor would not reach the required 1.21
gigawatts of power. For example, if the car achieved a speed of `>= 89` MPH
while the flux capacitor was only getting anywhere `>= 1.00` and `< 1.21`
gigawatts, the computer would put the power source in "limp home" mode, only
allowing it to generate roughly 300 watts - enough to power the dashboard
displays.

Additionally, when the _Mr. Fusion_ generator is being used to power hover mode,
and the car is hovering less than 12 feet off the ground, and the car is
traveling `>= 32` MPH, the generator would not engage time travel mode, thus not
generating the required 1.21 gigawatts necessary to power the flux capacitor.

Finally, in the case where the primary power source (typically configured to be
the plutonium nuclear reactor) is not able to generate more than 1 gigawatt of
power, but the secondary power source is capable of generating the necessary
remaining power to bring total power output to 1.21 gigawatts, allow a new
parallel power mode where power from both sources will be sent to the flux
capacitor. Previously the flux capacitor could only receive power from one
source at a time.
